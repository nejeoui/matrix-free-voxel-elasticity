This repository is the code-only public release accompanying the arXiv
preprint. It contains source code, experiment drivers, figure-generation
scripts, environment pins, citation metadata, and documentation. It
intentionally does not ship the manuscript source/PDF, submission manifests,
runtime snapshots, generated result files, raw logs, retained density arrays,
root data directories, or generated manuscript figures.

## Scope

The level-0 fused gather-GEMM-scatter operator is inherited infrastructure from
the companion paper:

> Yang, S., Wang, J., and Wang, Y. (2026).  
> *Matrix-Free 3D SIMP Topology Optimization with Fused Gather-GEMM-Scatter
> Kernels.* arXiv:2604.18020

The code packaged here implements the matrix-free full-Galerkin GMG hierarchy,
a Chebyshev-Jacobi smoother option, the mixed-precision level policy, the
GMG-integrated solver path, and the drivers used to evaluate solver behavior.

## Repository Layout

| `environment.yml` | Reference conda environment |

## Hardware and Software Requirements

- NVIDIA GPU with compute capability 8.0 or newer for the BF16 WMMA path.
- A 24 GiB card is needed for the largest E7 entry at 1M elements.
- Smaller experiments fit on lower-VRAM cards, but the largest scaling result
  does not.
- Python and package versions are pinned in `environment.yml`.

The code is primarily set up for an Ampere-or-newer CUDA stack. If your GPU
does not expose BF16 WMMA, the FP32/FP64 paths still remain useful for partial
experiments, but BF16-specific rows and tensor-core proxy measurements are not
directly comparable.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nbbllxx0/Mixed-Precision-GMG-SIMP.git
cd Mixed-Precision-GMG-SIMP
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate gmg-simp
```

The experiment and figure scripts resolve paths relative to the repository root
and do not require `pip install -e .`.

## Quick Sanity Check

```bash
python ci/smoke_test.py
```

This runs one FP64 V-cycle-preconditioned solve on a 64k cantilever probe and
checks that the relative residual drops below `1e-10` within 300 iterations.
If this fails, fix the local CUDA / CuPy stack before running the full suite.

## Step 1: Pre-Benchmark Validation Checks

```bash
python experiments/paper4/validate_phase1.py --out results_phase1.json
```

These checks gate the hierarchy before performance claims are collected.

| ID | Check |
| --- | --- |
| M1 | FP64 V-cycle against a direct solve |
| M2 | Outer-iteration bound on uniform-density probes |
| M3 | Matrix-free vs assembled-Galerkin compliance agreement |
| M4 | Chebyshev-Jacobi smoother convergence |
| M5 | Selected SIMP sanity probes over representative penalties |
| M6 | `kappa_eff <= 256` on the nominal probe |
| M7 | BF16 drop-in compliance error |
| M8 | Three-level FP32 hierarchy on representative benchmarks |

The output file `results_phase1.json` records the measured quantities and
pass/fail status for each gate.

Optional small diagnostic:

```bash
python experiments/paper4/estimate_preconditioned_kappa.py
```

This probe is not a headline benchmark. It is retained only to interpret the
PCG-vs-FGMRES policy used in different parts of the suite.

## Step 2: Main Benchmark Suite

Run the whole benchmark suite into an explicit local output directory:

```bash
python experiments/paper4/run_experiments_e1_e10.py --experiments all --out rerun_outputs/paper4
```

Run a subset:

```bash
python experiments/paper4/run_experiments_e1_e10.py --experiments E1 E2 E5B E6H E7 --out rerun_outputs/paper4
```

Timing controls:

| Environment variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PAPER4_N_WARMUP` | `2` | Warm-up trials discarded before timing |
| `PAPER4_N_TRIALS` | `10` | Timed trials used for reported mean/std |

Main outputs written under the selected output directory:

| Experiment | Primary outputs |
| --- | --- |
| E1 | `e1_vcycle_iters.csv` |
| E2 | `e2_per_solve_wall_time.csv`, `e2_per_solve_wall_time_trials.csv`, `e2_residual_histories.csv` |
| E3 | `e3_simp_speedup.csv`, `e3_simp_trajectory.csv` |
| E4 | `e4_tc_throughput.csv`, `e4_roofline.csv` |
| E5 | `e5_kappa_eff.csv`, `e5_bf16_validation.csv`, `e5_bf16_validation_residual_histories.csv` |
| E6 | `e6a_precision_ablation.csv`, `e6a_precision_ablation_trials.csv`, `e6b_depth_sweep.csv`, `e6b_depth_sweep_trials.csv`, `e6c_vcycle_vs_wcycle.csv`, `e6c_vcycle_vs_wcycle_trials.csv`, `e6d_smoother_type.csv`, `e6d_smoother_type_trials.csv`, `e6_sensitivity_surface.csv`, `e6_sensitivity_surface_trials.csv`, `e6_high_contrast_smoother.csv`, `e6_high_contrast_smoother_residual_histories.csv` |
| E7 | `e7_large_scale.csv`, `e7_large_scale_trials.csv` |
| E8 | `e8_external_baseline.csv`, `e8_external_baseline_trials.csv` |
| E9 | `e9_energy.csv`, `e9_energy_trials.csv` |
| E10 | `e10_robustness.csv`, `e10_basin.csv` |

## Step 3: Figure Generation From Local Outputs

Point the quantitative figure script at the output directory produced by a
local rerun:

```bash
cd figures
python plot_figures.py --results-dir ../rerun_outputs/paper4 --figs-dir ../rerun_outputs/paper4_figs
```

Qualitative gallery generation requires locally supplied density arrays:

```bash
cd figures
python make_3d_renders.py --renders-dir ../rerun_outputs/topology_renders --figs-dir ../rerun_outputs/paper4_figs
```

The released repository does not include retained density arrays or generated
figure directories.

## Important Interpretation Notes

- E2 wall-time ratios are measured against a Jacobi-PCG reference path that
  reaches the 200-iteration cap without convergence in all timed trials at
  64k, 216k, and 512k elements. Interpret these values as capped-baseline
  wall-time ratios, not as speedups over successful Jacobi solves.
- E3 is an auxiliary fixed 30-step SIMP schedule. It should be read as a
  same-schedule execution study, not as a matched-endpoint continuation
  comparison.
- E3 records both `compliance_err_k0_pct` and `compliance_err_final_pct`.
- Some generated CSVs retain compact code identifiers for benchmark cases and
  trajectory sources; `docs/ARTIFACT_MAP.md` maps those identifiers to the
  reader-facing labels used in the paper.
- E1, E2, E6(a-d), and E8 retain the paper's empirical PCG pairings for the
  headline FP32/FP64 comparison paths; the small
  `estimate_preconditioned_kappa.py` probe records an approximate symmetry
  defect, so those rows should be read as empirical solver pairings rather than
  as an exact SPD certificate.
- E6 sensitivity-surface runs use explicit FGMRES paths for both FP32 and BF16
  rows.
- E7 large-scale runs use FGMRES with restart 50.
- E10 uses FGMRES with restart 50; the headline robustness table uses
  `maxiter = 500`, while the broader basin screen uses `maxiter = 300`.
- In E7, `vram_delta_mb` is the setup-time hierarchy-allocation delta measured
  around `gmg.setup(E_e)`. It is not a peak setup-plus-solve memory trace.
- E8 reference timings use a cold-start GMG hierarchy-initialization
  measurement that reconstructs the FP32 GMG object and performs the first
  initialization call on each trial from precomputed free-set and
  element-connectivity tables.
- E4 benchmarks the 216k cantilever case (`120x60x30`) with a uniform
  `E_e = 1` field and an all-ones free-DOF input vector.
- E4 roofline guide rails use RTX 4090 vendor-spec theoretical ceilings; they
  are not measured saturation ceilings.
- E9 records the 216k cantilever solve (`120x60x30`, uniform `rho = 0.5`,
  `penal = 3.0`) and computes energy from timestamped NVML samples integrated
  over the measured solve interval. The sampler runs every `50 ms`; no explicit
  idle-power baseline is subtracted.
- The qualitative gallery is visual context only. It is not part of the
  E1-E10 quantitative result bundle.

## Troubleshooting

If `ci/smoke_test.py` fails:

- verify that CuPy can see the intended GPU
- make sure the CUDA toolkit and driver are compatible with the pinned
  environment
- clear stale local caches only after confirming you are not hitting a simple
  installation mismatch

If a 1M E7 run runs out of memory:

- reduce `PAPER4_N_TRIALS`
- run smaller subsets first
- do not interpret reduced-trial timing noise as a regression in solver logic

If figure generation fails:

- confirm that `--results-dir`, `--renders-dir`, and `--figs-dir` point to
  local outputs that actually exist
- regenerate benchmark CSVs before running `plot_figures.py`
- provide locally generated or locally retained density arrays before
  running `make_3d_renders.py`
